<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr />
<p>The three main focuses in my life are anthropology, art and youth work.
  I am actively involved in youth work and communication between the main Russian-speaking children camps in Estonia.
  At university, I took additional courses on working with children with trauma, as well as basic and social psychology.

  All my life I have been inventing stories, writing and sketching them into little comics. In my academic life I mainly focus on autoethnography, memory and economic anthropology.
</p>
<p>The reason why I got into web development is that I want to grow in different fields and make intersections between seemingly unlike areas of specialisation. But I think that such intersections change the scientific field and make it more alive and real.
  Besides, I'm a person who needs challenges and constant opportunity to create new neural pathways :)

<p>For a while, I ran a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kilgoretrout____/">book club</a>, where I was the curator, organizer, and all rolled into one. After it closed during pandemia, I recorded a couple of podcasts about books that can be found on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5J7jhCufSqTWhYNdPzLwZh?si=c2591aa9ab394a78&nd=1">Spotify</a>
  In my spare time, I like to go hiking, decorate my home and do air yoga.
